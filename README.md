# 🧠✨ MemoTech – Blender Accessibility Add-on

## 📖 Description

**MemoTech** is a student project developed at IIM Digital School by a team of 6 members:

- 👨‍💻 3 students from the Coding axis  
- 🎨 3 students from the 3D Animation axis  

The goal of the project was to create an accessible Blender add-on to help users — especially people with dyslexia or those who struggle to remember keyboard shortcuts — use Blender more easily.

The add-on was developed using Python and integrated directly into Blender.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Blender includes many powerful features, but also a large number of keyboard shortcuts that can be difficult to memorize.

MemoTech aims to:

- Improve accessibility  
- Reduce cognitive overload  
- Help users quickly find shortcuts  
- Provide visual learning support  


## 🧩 Features

### 📂 Memo Tab in Blender

After installation, a new **"Memo" tab** appears inside Blender.

Inside this tab:

- 📋 A list of keyboard shortcuts  
- 🔎 Easy access to the shortcut you're searching for  
- 🎥 A tutorial video for each shortcut  


### 🎥 Interactive Video Tutorials

Each shortcut includes a video demonstration that shows:

- What keys are pressed  
- When the mouse is clicked  
- Visual keyboard & mouse overlays  
- A clear step-by-step demonstration inside Blender  

This helps:

- Visual learners  
- People with dyslexia  
- Users who prefer demonstration over written documentation  


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python (Blender Add-on development)  
- 🎬 MP4 tutorial videos  
- 🧩 Blender Add-on system  


## ⚙️ Installation

### Step 1 – Install the Add-on

1. Open Blender  
2. Go to **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons**  
3. Click **Install**  
4. Drag & drop the `__main__.py` file  
5. Enable the add-on  


### Step 2 – Add the Tutorial Videos

⚠️ Important:

You must place the **MP4 folder** (containing all tutorial videos) inside your **Downloads** folder.

Current limitation:

The add-on searches for the video folder specifically inside the Downloads directory.  
We did not implement dynamic folder selection.


## 🚧 Project Status

🎓 Academic project completed at IIM.

The add-on works locally inside Blender but could be improved with:

- 🔎 Adding a search system to precisely find a specific keyboard shortcut (to avoid scrolling through the entire list)  
- 🗂️ Organizing shortcuts by themes (Modeling, Animation, Navigation, etc.)  
- 🎥 Creating more detailed and slower tutorial videos for better understanding  
- 📁 Custom video path selection  
- 🎨 Improved UI design  
- 📚 Expanding shortcut categories  
- ♿ Enhanced accessibility features  


## 👥 Team

MemoTech was built collaboratively by 6 students combining:

- 💻 Development skills  
- 🎨 3D production knowledge  
- 🧠 Accessibility-focused design thinking  


## 💡 Why MemoTech?

Blender is powerful — but not always beginner-friendly.

MemoTech helps users:

- Learn faster  
- Remember shortcuts  
- Feel less overwhelmed  
- Use Blender more confidently  


✨ A small tool made to make a big creative software more accessible.
